In the context of **Microsoft Azure**, the terms **Azure SQL** and **SQL Database** can be confusing because they are often used interchangeably â€” but they refer to different **deployment options** or **perspectives** of SQL Server services in Azure.

### 1. **Azure SQL** (Umbrella Term)

* **Definition**: "Azure SQL" is **not a specific service**, but rather a **family of managed SQL Server-based services** provided by Microsoft in the Azure cloud.
* **Includes**:

  * **Azure SQL Database**
  * **Azure SQL Managed Instance**
  * **SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines**

Think of it as a **brand name** that groups all SQL-related offerings on Azure.

### 2. **Azure SQL Database** (One of the Services under Azure SQL)

* **Definition**: A **fully managed** Platform-as-a-Service (**PaaS**) database offering.
* **Key features**:

  * Serverless compute and Hyperscale storage options
  * No access to the underlying OS
  * Handles patching, backups, high availability
  * Ideal for cloud-native apps
* **Use case**: When you want a simple, scalable database without managing infrastructure.

---

### 3. **SQL Server on Azure VM** (Infrastructure-as-a-Service / IaaS)

* Part of Azure SQL, but **not** the same as SQL Database.
* You get full control over SQL Server installed on a Windows or Linux VM.
* Suitable for applications needing **OS-level access** or **SQL Server Agent** features not available in PaaS offerings.

---

### 4. **Azure SQL Managed Instance**

* A **hybrid** between Azure SQL Database and SQL Server on VMs.
* Offers **near 100% compatibility** with on-prem SQL Server.
* Ideal for **migrating legacy SQL Server apps** with minimal changes.

### Summary Table:

| Feature                       | Azure SQL Database    | SQL Managed Instance   | SQL Server on Azure VM       |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Service type                  | PaaS                  | PaaS                   | IaaS                         |
| Managed by Azure              | Yes                   | Yes                    | Partial (VM managed by you)  |
| OS-level access               | No                    | No                     | Yes                          |
| Full SQL Server compatibility | Partial               | Nearly full            | Full                         |
| Best for                      | New apps/cloud-native | Migration from on-prem | Custom setups/legacy systems |

### Conclusion:

* **"Azure SQL"** is the umbrella term.
* **"Azure SQL Database"** is a specific **PaaS** offering under the Azure SQL umbrella.
* The main difference is that **Azure SQL** refers to a **collection of services**, while **Azure SQL Database** is **one specific service** within that collection.
